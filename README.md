This is a music app clone using my preferred tech stack as of now

## Getting Started

first, create a .env file in the root directory and take the key value pairs from .env.example, copy them into .env, change the value to your values.

second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
